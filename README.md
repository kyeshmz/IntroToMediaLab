# MAS-S90
A wicked smart introduction to MAS. 

This is a live and collaborative document, and always needs updating and more content. Feel free to fork, edit and perform a pull request, I'll approve it immediately.

Created by Tobin South in 2022 while TA'ing the MAS-S90 (Intro to MAS) class.
Inspired by [The Insider's Guide For New People at the Media Lab](https://alumni.media.mit.edu/~benres/newpeople/) from Benjamin Resner in class of 2001.
