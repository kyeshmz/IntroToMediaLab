There are so many random things in here it's hard to know where to start. Poke around.
Some useful stuff:
* [Setup Media Lab VPN (Good for printing)](https://nuwiki.media.mit.edu/bin/view/Necsysdocs/HowToVPN)
* Discover the Matlabber machines
* [Printers üñ®Ô∏è](https://nuwiki.media.mit.edu/bin/view/Main/LabPrinters)


### MAS Links
I often find myself needing a link that was sent one time to a Media Lab website that turns out to be absolutely critical and I can never find again. Here are some of those pages:
* [What MAS courses do you need to take?](https://www.media.mit.edu/posts/registration-information/)
* [MAS Quick Links page](https://www.media.mit.edu/posts/quick-links/)


### Random Other

* See the calendar of all the room bookings: [Conference Room and Resource Calendars](https://roomrequest.media.mit.edu)
