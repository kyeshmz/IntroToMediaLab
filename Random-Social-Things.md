# Cool Random Media Lab Things

Lots of weird things happen in the Media Lab, and it can be hard to keep track of all of them over time. 
Here is a non-exhaustive collection of interestign stuff that happens sometimes, with links to things.

### 99 Fridays
The event is for the extended Media Lab community.  99F is all about co-creation, so everyone joins a participatory crew to make the event even better. This is an expressive leave-no-trace event, so bring your own cup and bring your best costume and dance moves.  You can bring a +1 but make sure they register with this form.

### Sci-Fi Library
The SciFi Library (scifilib), located in E15-384, is a space for the community to learn about the past, and get inspired to create the future. The Library is scaffolded a generously donated collection of hundreds of science fiction books, which span many divergent possibilities for what the future might hold. To surface many of the whacky ideas lost to the sands of time, it also contains a ecclectic collection of artifacts from long gone groups (such as Design Fiction and Scalable Cooperation).
